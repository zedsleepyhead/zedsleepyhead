<h2>Programs I use</h2>
<br>
These are programs I generally use for graphic design, or web design.

<h3>Figma</h3>
Figma is a graphic design tool mainly used for collaborative UI prototyping.<br>
Took me a while to learn as we made a sudden switch to this in Meower.<br>
I've used this for many UI designs within Meower.<br>

<h3>Scratch</h3>
Scratch is a block-based programming language.<br>
I've used Scratch for almost 4 years now, and am very good at it.<br>
I'm paticularly good at the Scratch vector editor, even with it's multitude of limitations.<br>

<h3>Pixlr</h3>
Pixlr is a photoshop-esque online tool.<br>
I've used this to edit some photos, or create UI concepts, however I've sense changed to Photoshop and Figma.<br>
Pixlr is very similar to photoshop, and it made for an easy transition from Pixlr to PS.<br>

<h3>Repl.it</h3>
Repl.it is a collaborative online coding website, with a lot of languages to choose from.<br>
I mainly use repl.it for coding HTML webpages, as well as making the CSS for them.<br>
I'm not that good at JS.<br>

<h3>Adobe Dreamweaver</h3>
Dreamweaver is a website code editor, for HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, etc.<br>
I use this for it's WYSIWYG aspect, for easy editing.<br>

<h3>Adobe After Effects</h3>
Adobe After Effects is a VFX and motion graphic video editor.<br>
I mainly use it to make Meower-related videos and announcments.<br>
