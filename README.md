<h1>Welcome to my GitHub page!</h1>
I'm currently working on Meower UI/UX design, and just overall graphic design<br>
I am learning adobe stuff (photoshop, illustrator animate, after effects, etc.)<br>
<br><h2>Meower<br></h2><img style="filter: brightness(100);" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d994e4dccc2e603be23b9689b45428463aa171903ee60acb81c75bc83c4a4214/68747470733a2f2f6d656f7765722e6f72672f6173736574732f6c6f676f2e737667"><br>Meower is a free, open-source, and non-profit social media platform. Meower is also a (currently WIP) alternative to Twitter, Discord, and Reddit, completely free of advertising, tracking, data collection, and more! <br><br>The website and launch is available at https://meower.org<br><br>Go to https://github.com/meower-media-co to see the source code

<h2>Programs I use</h2>
<br>
These are programs I generally use for graphic design.

<h3>Figma</h3>
Figma is a graphic design tool mainly used for collaborative UI prototyping.<br>
Took me a while to learn as we made a sudden switch to this in Meower.<br>
I've used this for many UI designs within Meower.<br>

<h3>Adobe After Effects</h3>
Adobe After Effects is a VFX and motion graphic video editor.<br>
Self-teaching, I mainly use it to make Meower-related videos and announcments.<br>

<h3>Adobe Photoshop</h3>
I don't really need to explain Photoshop.<br>
Self-teaching, very much a beginner, I use this for photo editing.
