<h2>Programs I use</h2>
<br>
These are programs I generally use for graphic design.

<h3>Figma</h3>
Figma is a graphic design tool mainly used for collaborative UI prototyping.<br>
Took me a while to learn as we made a sudden switch to this in Meower.<br>
I've used this for many UI designs within Meower.<br>

<h3>Adobe After Effects</h3>
Adobe After Effects is a VFX and motion graphic video editor.<br>
Self-teaching, I mainly use it to make Meower-related videos and announcments.<br>

<h3>Adobe Photoshop</h3>
I don't really need to explain Photoshop.<br>
Self-teaching, very much a beginner, I use this for photo editing.
